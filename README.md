# Typeform ETL

A python class and main function to extract and continuously sync data from a [Typeform.com](https://typeform.com) account.

## Installation

### Requirements

You should prefer Python 3 packages from your operating system.

So under Fedora Linux:

```shell
dnf install python3-requests python3-sqlalchemy python3-pandas python3-configobj python3-mysql
```
Under Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8:

```shell
dnf install python3-requests python3-sqlalchemy python3-configobj mariadb-connector-c-devel mariadb-connector-c gcc
pip3 install mysqlclient --user
```
This MariaDB connector is the one that works with SQLAlchemy (used by the module). Other connectors as PyMySQL failed our tests.

Installing `mysqlclient` with `pip` requires compilers and MariaDB development framework pre-installed in the system, as shown in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux section.

### Install the module

```shell
pip3 install TypeformETL --user
```

All unsatisfied dependencies (such as Pandas on RHEL) will be installed along.

Or, to upgrade:

```shell
pip3 install -U TypeformETL --no-deps --user
```
Remove the `--no-deps` if you wish to upgrade also dependent modules as pandas and numpy.

## Usage

[Get a personal access token](https://developer.typeform.com/get-started/personal-access-token/) from [Typeform's admin portal](https://admin.typeform.com/account#/section/tokens). We'll call it `___API_KEY___` from now on.

### With plain command line

```shell
python3 -m TypeformETL --typeform "___API_KEY___" --database 'mysql://user:password@host/dbname'
```

Add `--restart` to get and sync all data from Typeform, not just last updates.

Add `--updatedb` to do everything except update database. Good for tests.

Add `--debug` to be more verbose.

### Config file

If you want to not pass arguments through command line, you can also use a config file.
Use `--config` to pass a config file name. By default, the main module will look for a file name called `syncFromTypeform.conf` in the current directory.
Arguments from config file and command line will be combined giving priority to the ones passed in command line.
So if a database URL is passed both in command line and config file, the command line will be used.

### With CRON

I have these 2 entries together on my crontab and then I don't need a config file:

```shell
@hourly    python3 -m TypeformETL --typeform "___API_KEY___" --database 'mysql://user:password@host/dbname' --tableprefix 'tf_'
30 3 * * 0 python3 -m TypeformETL --typeform "___API_KEY___" --database 'mysql://user:password@host/dbname' --tableprefix 'tf_' --restart
```

Which will run a sync every hour. And once a week will reset data tables and bring all data from scratch.

### Into a Python program

```python
from TypeformETL import TypeformETL

tf = TypeformETL(
	token='___API_KEY___',
	dburl='mysql://user:password@host/dbname',
	restart=False,     # True to reset data tables and bring all data from scratch
	dbupdate=True,     # Wether to simulate or actually write in database
	tableprefix='tf_'  # To better organize your tables
)


# Read Typeform updates and write to DB
tf.sync()
```

## Database
A SQL database must exist. MySQL and MariaDB tested. Use the `examples/datamodel.sql` script to create the database.

Having “`tf_`” as a table prefix, these are the objects (tables and views) that will be created and updated:

| Table/View        | Name             | Contents                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| table             | `tf_forms`         | Contains metadata about forms                                                                                                             |
| table             | `tf_form_items`    | Contains metadata about form items (text fields, checkboxes) related to their parent forms                                                |
| table             | `tf_answers`       | Contains all answers to all fields of all forms; each complete form response has an entry in the `tf_responses` table.                                                                                           |
| table             | `tf_responses`     | Contains all responses and metadata to all forms; each form **response** has an entry here, each form field **answer** has an entry in the `tf_answers` table. |
| table             | `tf_options`       | Operational table used by the syncer                                                                                                      |
| table             | `tf_synclog`       | Operational table that logs every sync with some simple statistics                                                                        |
| view              | `tf_super_answers` | A convenient view that joins together table `tf_answers`, `tf_responses`, `tf_form_items`, `tf_forms`                                     |
| view              | `tf_nps`           | The calculated current [NPS (Net Promoter Score)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) of all numerical fields (only a few fields might have a real NPS semantic)                |
| view              | `tf_nps_daily`     | The NPS of all numerical fields per day; can be used to see evolution of some NPS along time.                                             |
| view              | `tf_nps_daily_mv`  | A backwards compatible name for the `tf_nps_daily` view    |

The module makes `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE` operations. Make sure the database connection user has granted permission to all these operations.

SQL definition for all these tables and views can be found in `examples/datamodel.sql`.

## Net Promoter Score

A common use of Typeform service is to measure user satisfaction through questions like “From 0 to 10, what is the chance of recommending this web site/app/service to a friend?”.

Once all answers are structured in a database its easy to calculate, from answers to a specific form field, both current NPS and NPS evolution as time series.

SQL views `tf_nps` and `tf_nps_daily` respectively will deliver this information. The `tf_nps_daily` is quite advanced and only possible (in one view) when using advanced SQL Window functions:

```sql
create view tf_nps_daily as 
select
	a.form as form_id,
	fi.name as field_name,
	r.submitted as date,
	fi.type as type,
	f.title as form_title,
	fi.title as field_title,
	
 	((count(case when a.answer>=9 then 1 else NULL end) over day)-(count(case when a.answer<7 then 1 else NULL end) over day))/(count(a.answer) over day) as NPS_ofdate,
	count(case when a.answer<7 then 1 else NULL end) over day as detractors,
	count(case when a.answer between 7 and 8 then 1 else NULL end) over day as passives,
	count(case when a.answer>=9 then 1 else NULL end) over day as promoters,
	count(a.answer) over day as total,
	
	((count(case when a.answer>=9 then 1 else NULL end) over untilday)-(count(case when a.answer<7 then 1 else NULL end) over untilday))/(count(a.answer) over untilday) as NPS_cumulative,
	count(case when a.answer<7 then 1 else NULL end) over untilday as detr_cumulative,
	count(case when a.answer between 7 and 8 then 1 else NULL end) over untilday as pass_cumulative,
	count(case when a.answer>=9 then 1 else NULL end) over untilday as prom_cumulative,
	count(a.answer) over untilday as totl_cumulative
from
	tf_answers a,
	tf_responses r,
	tf_form_items fi,
	tf_forms f
where
	a.data_type_hint in ('number')
	and r.submitted is not NULL
	and r.id = a.response
	and fi.id = a.field
	and fi.form = a.form
	and f.id = a.form
window
	day as (partition by date(r.submitted), a.form, a.field),
	untilday as (partition by a.form, a.field order by r.submitted asc rows unbounded preceding)
order by
	a.form, a.field, r.submitted asc
```

The `tf_nps` view is simpler:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW tf_nps AS
select
	a.form as form_id,
	fi.name as field_name,
	min(r.submitted) as first,
	max(r.submitted) as last,
	fi.type as type,
	f.title as form_title,
	fi.title as field_title,
 	((count(case when a.answer>=9 then 1 else NULL end))-(count(case when a.answer<7 then 1 else NULL end)))/(count(a.answer)) as NPS,
	count(case when a.answer<7 then 1 else NULL end) as detractors,
	count(case when a.answer between 7 and 8 then 1 else NULL end) as passives,
	count(case when a.answer>=9 then 1 else NULL end) as promoters,
	count(a.answer) as total,
	avg(a.answer) as average,
	std(a.answer) as std_deviation
from
	tf_answers a,
	tf_responses r,
	tf_form_items fi,
	tf_forms f
where
	a.data_type_hint in ('number')
	and r.submitted is not NULL
	and r.id = a.response
	and fi.id = a.field
	and fi.form = a.form
	and f.id = a.form
group by
	form_id, field_name
order by
	a.form, a.field, r.submitted asc
```

Once set, you can query the NPS for a specific field as a time series (`tf_nps_daily`) or its last value (`tf_nps`) like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tf_nps_daily WHERE form_id='to6xfp' AND field_name='353eb07c-15bf-4669-9793-9c0ec33f818a'
```

Resulting data, when graphed, looks like this:
